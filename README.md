# üìç Google Maps Saved place organizer
Google Maps recently introduced a limit of 3000 saved places in the Want to go category in mobile. They still appear on desktop but make Google Maps unusable for digital nomads with a large number of pins. This script makes it possible to reorganize saved locations into smaller topic lists at scale.

# How to use the script

To use the script:
1. Create lists named `Food`, `Test`, `Coffee`, `Bakery`, `Dessert` in your Google Maps Saved section. (You can modify the `targetCategories` mapping to add support for different lists.)
2. Open the `Want to go` list
3. Copy and paste the code from the `console-script.js` file into your browser Console (`Cmd + Option + I`) and run it
4. Keep the tab open while until the script finishes running. It may get stuck in which case just refresh the page and run it again to continue.
